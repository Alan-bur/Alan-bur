# 🫧 A bit of me
I'm not just another modern UI/UX Designer. I'm one hopeful person who thinks we should bring the best from 2000s aesthetics back to user interfaces. Nowadays interfaces look boring and lack personality. I don't think discarding [Frutiger Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_Aero) entirely was the answer. Why not keeping the best of it? We could have the best user experience and a pretty interface all together! 

## 🧩 This is what I do here
Since I was a teenager, interfaces is what caught my attention. I found a way to mix it with the other thing I love the most... videogames! Besides wireframing websites and apps, I create 4K retro texture packs that bring childhood memories back to modern screens.

## 🎈 Still not following? =)
Don't forget to follow me on Github and give a 🌟 to your favorite project! That helps a lot and I recommend checking the Youtube channel as I upload texture pack showcases, game mods and useful tutorials you might find interesting.
